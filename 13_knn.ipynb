    "# K-nearest Neighbour (KNN)\n",
    "> A non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is a `supervised machine learning` algorithm that can be used to solve both `classification and regression` problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a `non-parametric`, lazy learning algorithm. `Non-parametric means that it does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution`. Lazy learning means that it does not require any training data points for model generation. All training data used in the testing phase. This makes training faster and testing phase slower and costlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of KNN:**\n",
    "- Simple to implement\n",
    "- No need to build a model, tune several parameters, or make additional assumptions\n",
    "- The algorithm is versatile. It can be used for classification, regression, and search\n",
    "- It is a non-parametric method, which means it is flexible to the distribution of the data\n",
    "- It has a relatively high accuracy but is sensitive to the scale of the data and irrelevant features\n",
    "- It is a lazy learner, which means it generalizes data during the testing phase rather than the training phase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of KNN:**\n",
    "- The algorithm gets significantly slower as the number of examples and/or predictors/independent variables increase\n",
    "- Its performance can be significantly degraded by the presence of noisy or irrelevant features\n",
    "- It is sensitive to the scale of the data and irrelevant features\n",
    "- Accuracy can be degraded if the data is imbalanced\n",
    "- it is computationally expensive to find the k nearest neighbours when the dataset is very large\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where do we use KNN?**\n",
    "- KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry.\n",
    "- KNN can be used for recommendation systems, semantic searching, and anomaly detection.\n",
    "- It can be use in the field of finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition, and video recognition.\n",
    "- Banking laon approval system, customer segmentation, and credit card fraud detection.\n",
    "- It can used in healthcare for predicting the disease of a patient based on the symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does KNN work?**\n",
    "- The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.\n",
    "- KNN captures the idea of similarity (sometimes called distance, proximity, or closeness) with some mathematics we might have learned in our childhood— calculating the distance between points using the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It can use for regression by using mean or median of the k-nearest neighbours. \n",
    "It can use for classification by using mode of the k-nearest neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to find the neighbours in KNN?**\n",
    "- The distance between the new point and all the other points in the dataset is calculated.\n",
    "- The closest k points to the new point are selected.\n",
    "- The most common classification of these k points is the classification of the new point.\n",
    "- The average of these k points is the regression of the new point.\n",
    "- The distance can be calculated using `different methods` such as:\n",
    "  - Euclidean Distance\n",
    "  - Manhattan Distance\n",
    "  - Minkowski Distance\n",
    "  - Hamming Distance"

    "1. `le = LabelEncoder()`: This line creates an instance of the LabelEncoder class.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. `X[col] = le.fit_transform(X[col])`: If the column is of type 'object' or 'category', this line applies the LabelEncoder to the column. The `fit_transform` method first learns the mapping (fit) from labels to numbers, and then applies the mapping to the data (transform). The result is a column of integers that represent the original categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this code is run, all the categorical columns in `X` will have been converted to numerical columns, with each unique category represented by a unique integer. This will allow you to use `X` as input to a machine learning algorithm like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)."
