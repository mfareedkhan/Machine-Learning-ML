    "| Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | Easy to understand and calculate. Gives a direct average measure of how much the predictions deviate from the actual values. | Does not heavily penalize large errors. | If MAE is 0, the model is perfect. If MAE is 0.5, on average, the model's predictions are 0.5 units away from the actual values. |\n",
    "| Mean Squared Error (MSE) | More sensitive to outliers than MAE as it squares the errors before averaging. | Squaring the errors can lead to overestimation of the model's badness if there are large errors. | If MSE is 0, the model is perfect. If MSE is 1, on average, the square of the model's predictions are 1 unit away from the square of the actual values. |\n",
    "| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | Even more sensitive to outliers than MSE. Gives a relatively high weight to large errors. | Like MSE, squaring the errors can lead to overestimation of the model's badness if there are large errors. | If RMSE is 0, the model is perfect. If RMSE is 1, on average, the square root of the model's predictions are 1 unit away from the square root of the actual values. |\n",
    "| R-Squared | Provides an indication of the goodness of fit of a set of predictions to the actual values. In terms of percentage, it explains how much the total variance is represented by the model. | It assumes that every independent variable in the model helps to explain the dependent variable. It can't determine whether the coefficient estimates and predictions are biased. | If R-Squared is 1, the model perfectly predicts the actual values. If R-Squared is 0, the model does not explain any of the variability of the response data around its mean. |\n",
    "| Adjusted R-Squared | Takes into account the number of predictors in the model. It only increases if the new predictor improves the model more than would be expected by chance. | It can be negative, and it's only applicable in the context of multiple linear regression. | If Adjusted R-Squared is 1, the model perfectly predicts the actual values, taking into account the number of predictors.
