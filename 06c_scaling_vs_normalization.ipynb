    "| **Purpose**           | Changes the range of data so all features are on a similar scale, without altering the shape of distribution | Changes the shape of the distribution of data to fit within a specific range (like 0 to 1). This includes transforming `skewed data` to approximate a normal distribution |\n",
    "| **Algorithms**        | Used in algorithms that use Euclidean distance or gradient descent, such as KNN, SVM, and linear regression. | Used in algorithms that do not assume any distribution of the data like K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks. |\n",
    "| **Common Methods**    | StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, MaxAbsScaler, RobustScaler. | MinMaxScaler, Square Root Transformation, BoxCox Transformation, Log Transformation |\n",
    "| **Use Cases**         | Used when features have different ranges. | Used when the dataset does not follow a Gaussian distribution. |\n",
